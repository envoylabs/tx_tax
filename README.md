# tx_tax

This is a utility for pulling down received amounts for in this case a service that takes a fee and burns a fee.

It assumes you have a fully synced node with indexing on - see the utility bash script in this repo.

More utils in time as we need them.

## Installation

Sorry, at the moment this is low-key only runnable by Clojure dweebs.

## Usage

Run via the REPL.

## Disclaimer

As this works on dumped data and the logs are arrays (!!!) rather than maps, this feels brittle as anything.

Not guaranteed to work, use at your own risk, YMMV, etc.
